				<h2>Chinese Food History</h2>
				<br>
				<p>Chinese food revolved around gastronomy; tasting, experiencing, and 
				seeing the food, not just eating. By the time confucius came along, food 
				had practically become an art. If the rice was not white, or if the meat 
				was too thin, people would not eat it. Cooking was a serious business, 
				and an inexperienced chef could easily make mistakes, leading to bad sales, 
				and ultimately, a close of business. Due to the adoption of cutlery, the 
				Chinese made foods bite sized pieces, or tender enough to be picked apart 
				easily, for convenience when using chopsticks. During the han dynasty, the 
				Chinese started to work on forms of preservation, such as jerky, in order 
				to boost the lifetime of the supplies the soldiers needed to survive. 
				Finally, during the qing dynasty, gastronomy started to make a comeback, 
				and famous gastronomes such as Yuan Mei started to focus primarily on 
				extracting the maximum taste, and flavour of the food.
				</p>
				
				
				<h3>Chinese Food now</h3>
				<p>Now, fast food such as deep fried noodles and rice are starting to make 
				an appearance. Basic etiquette is that youths should not sit down before 
				elders, and similarly, youths should not eat before elders. Holding the 
				bottom part of a bowl is looked down upon as well, since it resembles the 
				act of begging, and putting chopsticks in a bowl of rice vertically isn’t 
				accepted either, since it resembles the tradition of putting a bowl of rice 
				over the dead. Knives are also considered not respectful, as chopsticks 
				can do the job. Chinese food now still revolves around it’s history; most 
				<img src = "images/chinabowl.jpg" width = "350" height = "515" alt = bowl_of_chinese_food />
				meals are bite sized or tender, and gastronomy is still a huge part of 
				the chinese culture. In fact, you can still see this today. For example, 
				many Chinese favourites are bite sized, such as spring rolls, dumplings, and 
				all types of asian meat. They are also quite visually pleasing, and in order 
				to keep the flavours to the maximum, Asians even developed MSG, a "drug" that 
				keeps flavours to a max, and it's widely used in cheap food in order to enhance 
				the taste. It's also used as last resort to try to keep cheap food on par 
				with traditional food.</p>
