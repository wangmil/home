				<h2>Korean Food History</h2>
				<br>
				<p>Korean food changed greatly depending on the time. For example, during 
				the three kingdoms period, cold and fermented foods such as kimchi arose, 
				and during the Goryeo period, foods from outside were brought in, and now 
				they are some of Korea's most popular dishes. examples of these would be 
				dumplings, mandu, grilled meat, noodles, and the use of black pepper. 
				During the Joseon period, technological agricultural advances were being 
				made, and books on farming and agriculture were being made. New crops were 
				being imported from the new world, and some were favoured, such as 
				potatoes and sweet potatoes, as they grew in previously unused soils, 
				and were fairly easy to cultivate. Later, when Japan colonized Korea, 
				many of the farms were taken to support their growing population, and so 
				many small farms were made into big ones, resulting in a bigger harvest. 
				Rice production grew significantly to support Japan's war efforts, and 
				Koreans ended up growing other grains to support themselves. Each Korean 
				usually only got around to having two meals per day during the winter, 
				and 3 during the summer. the poor, however, barely scraped by, and were 
				only able to get around one bowl of white rice per year, and relied 
				primarily on cheaper wheat, such as millet or barley. During the wars, 
				even the middle class started to get affected, so they started making use 
				of inexpensive meats and made dishes out of them. After the war passed, 
				South Korea turned to industrial processes to help feed the nation, and 
				the overall quality of the food has been rising. Overall, Korean cuisine 
				has been through some harsh times but has risen up despite the hardships.

				<h3>Korean Food now</h3>
				<p>Eating etiquette in Korea is relatively relaxed compared to the Chinese 
				and Japanese; other than basic table manners, many of the "rules" aren't 
				stressed. For example, although the oldest man of the house should get 
				served first, many people decide against it in favour of sitting down 
				together and talking as a family. Some rules do go beyond your run of 
				the mill table manners, such as not talking of eating something alive, 
				or keeping the spoons clean, as they are communal. Drinking etiquette, 
				however, is another story altogether. It is quite significant in Korean 
				dining, especially when drinking alcohol. The rules are as follows: Each 
				younger man must turn away from the oldest male and cover their mouths as 
				they drink. Drinking alcohol face to face is considered impolite, and 
				therefore looked down upon. Guests also cannot refuse a drink when asked 
				one time, but on the second, they are expected to politely refuse. On the 
				third time, the guess can either deny or accept, but if they deny, they 
				will not be asked a third time. Overall, Korean etiquette is quite relaxed 
				when it comes to food, but drinks are another story.</p>
