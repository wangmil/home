				<h2>Asian Food</h2>
				<br>
				<p>Asian food has greatly influenced Western food. You literally can’t go 
				to a food store and not find some type of Asian food, whether it be sushi, 
				dumplings, or hot pot. 
				</p>
				<h3>History</h3>
				<p>Asian food first made its way here through Asian immigrants to Canada; 
				as they moved, their food did too. Soon, Asian fruits such as peaches and 
				cherries started to gain traction in western society, and before they knew 
				it, were deeply ingrained. The immigration of these people also lead to 
				business opportunities, since the people developed a taste for their own 
				culture's food. Before society knew it, Asian food was being sold at almost 
				every store, and the ones who refused eventually gave in. While the 
				majority seemed content with just a small section of their stores occupied 
				by these stores, others took a risk and made their entire store Asian, 
				for better or worse. On the good side, many of these stores got the 
				attention of Asian people, who were growing rapidly in population, and 
				they received a steady income. However, most people at the time were not 
				Asian, and the stores that switched risked their business. Nowadays, Asian 
				food is found all over Canada and is deeply ingrained in our society.</p>

				<h3>Asian Food Now</h3>
				<p>Asian food now consists of Central Asian, East Asian, North Asian, 
				South Asian, Southeast Asian, and West Asian Food. Common ingredients 
				in these cultures include, but are not limited to, rice, ginger, garlic, 
				sesame seeds, chillies, dried onions, soy, and tofu. Common ways of 
				cooking include stir-frying, steaming, and deep-frying. In this website, 
				I’m going to be covering a few East Asian cultures, which includes china, 
				japan, and Korea. Most east Asian cuisines use oils, fats and sauces. 
				The food made by these cultures includes the following well-known dishes: 
				sushi, dumplings, and BBQ skewers, which are Japanese, Chinese, and Korean, 
				respectively.</p>

				<h2>Fun facts</h2>
				<h4>In most cases, Chinese food is prepared into bite sized pieces, ready
				for snacking!</h4>

				<h4>In Korea, all the dishes are served at once!</h4>
				<br>
				<h4>Japanese sushi chefs must go through rigorous training before being able
				to make sushi!</h4>
				<br>
				<h4>It is hard to be this enthusiastic!</h4>
