				<h2>Japanese Food History</h2>
				<br>
				<p>Japan cuisine was developed off of the influence of China. The culture 
				valued the visual appeal of food, and it also valued that taste be brought 
				out to the fullest. Rice, wheat and soybeans are all staples in Japanese 
				culture, in many ways since the Japanese were Buddhists; they wouldn’t eat 
				meat or fish. Shortly after, however, the fish ban was revoked, but the 
				meat ban stayed the same. The Japanese used very little spice and got their 
				meat from fishing, which has become yet another staple in Japanese culture. 
				The Japanese ate fish in every one of their meals, and oil and fat were 
				generally avoided due to the healthy lifestyle of the Japanese. All of these 
				factors were key in making Japanese cuisine what it is today, and it’s 
				also why Japanese cuisine is so vastly different than other east Asian 
				cuisines. Preserved fish picked up, and before long sushi was invented. 
				Putting raw fish in boiled rice triggered something called lactic acid 
				fermentation, which prevents the spread of bacteria on the fish. Recently, 
				a new ruler declared eating meat was legal, since he wanted to embrace 
				western culture, and now people from japan eat meat. However, fish still 
				dominates the Japanese market.</p>
				
				<h3>Japanese Food now</h3>
				<p>Now Japanese food is about combining the staple food, rice, with other 
				<img src = "images/Takoyaki.jpg" width = "350" height = "490" alt = Takoyaki />
				dishes. Since Japanese tradition says that different foods shouldn't touch 
				each other, each dish does not touch, so they are usually given their 
				respective bowls or plates. When there is not enough room, or there are 
				not enough plates, the food is separated by some form of non-toxic material, 
				such as leaves. Due to this, placing main dishes on top of rice is usually 
				frowned upon. Rice is known as the staple food, but seafood could be 
				considered just as well-known; seafood is present in almost every single 
				dish the Japanese make. For example, sushi and takoyaki, which both 
				involve seafood. The Japanese also care a LOT about freshness - so much 
				so that they sometimes eat the food alive. Overall, Japanese food is 
				fresh, and centered around rice and seafood.</p>
